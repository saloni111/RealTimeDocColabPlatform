# DocHub - Real-Time Collaborative Document Platform

A real-time collaborative document editing platform I built to solve the frustration of working on group projects. Think Google Docs, but built from scratch with Go microservices. This project demonstrates my ability to build complex, production-ready applications that actually work in real-world scenarios.

## Demo Website

DocHub is a full-featured collaborative document platform that allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously in real-time. The app uses Go microservices with gRPC communication and DynamoDB for data persistence, implementing real-time collaboration features that rival commercial solutions.

**What you'll see:**
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Multiple users typing simultaneously
- Instant document synchronization
- Smooth cursor behavior
- Professional Google Docs-like interface

## Built With

- **Go** - Backend microservices with high performance and concurrency
- **gRPC** - Fast inter-service communication for real-time updates
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database for flexible document storage
- **Protocol Buffers** - Efficient data serialization for gRPC
- **Docker** - Containerization for consistent deployment
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Frontend with Material Design principles

## What I Learned

**Real-Time Systems:** I gained deep understanding of how real-time collaboration actually works. It's not just about WebSockets - it's about efficient data synchronization, conflict resolution, and ensuring data consistency across multiple users.

**Microservices Architecture:** Building this taught me how to design services that can communicate effectively while maintaining independence. The API Gateway pattern became crucial for managing multiple service endpoints.

**Database Design:** Working with DynamoDB taught me about NoSQL design patterns, especially for document-based applications. I learned how to structure data for efficient queries and real-time updates.

**Production Deployment:** This project forced me to think about production concerns from day one. Health checks, logging, environment configuration, and Docker deployment became essential parts of the development process.

**User Experience:** I discovered that real-time collaboration is only useful if it's reliable. Users expect changes to appear instantly and consistently - anything less feels broken. This pushed me to focus on reliability over fancy features.

**Performance Optimization:** Real-time updates require careful attention to performance. I learned to optimize database queries, minimize network overhead, and ensure the UI remains responsive even during heavy collaboration.

**Testing Real-World Scenarios:** The most valuable learning came from actually using the app with multiple people. I found bugs I never would have discovered through unit testing alone, especially around edge cases in real-time collaboration.

## Installation

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saloni111/RealTimeDocColabPlatform.git
cd RealTimeDocColabPlatform

# Start all services
./start_all.sh

# Visit the application
open http://localhost:8080
```

**Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy with Docker
./deploy.sh

# Or use Docker Compose directly
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Real-World Testing

I've tested this platform with actual users in real collaboration scenarios:

- **Group Project Planning:** Used it for brainstorming sessions with 4-5 people editing simultaneously
- **Document Review:** Had multiple reviewers commenting and editing the same document
- **Meeting Notes:** Real-time note-taking during team meetings
- **Code Documentation:** Collaborative writing of technical documentation

The platform handles these scenarios reliably, with changes appearing instantly across all users. The real-time collaboration actually works as advertised - no more "did you save?" or "can you refresh?" questions.

## What Makes This Special

This isn't just another tutorial project. I built this to solve a real problem I experienced, and I made sure it actually works in production scenarios. The real-time collaboration is reliable enough that I'd trust it for important work.

The code is clean, well-structured, and follows Go best practices. I've eliminated redundancy, implemented proper error handling, and made the system production-ready with Docker deployment.

## Future Improvements

While the core functionality is solid, I see several areas for enhancement:
- Enhanced authentication with OAuth integration
- File upload support for images and attachments
- Advanced collaboration features like comments and suggestions
- Performance optimizations for very large documents
- Mobile app development

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of my journey to become a better software engineer. Special thanks to the Go community for excellent documentation and examples that made this possible.
